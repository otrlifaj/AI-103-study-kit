# Develop a speech-capable generative AI application

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Deploy speech-capable generative AI models in Microsoft Foundry.
- Use a generative AI model to transcribe speech.
- Use a generative AI model to synthesize speech.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Experience with deploying generative AI models in Microsoft Foundry.
- Programming experience.

---

## Introduction

Speech transcription and synthesis are useful capabilities in many scenarios, including:

- Documenting spoken conversations in calls and meetings.
- Generating captions for videos or presentations.
- Creating audible user interfaces to improve application accessibility.
- Developing hands-free AI assistants that read text messages or emails aloud.

In this module, we'll explore how to use speech-capable generative AI models in Microsoft Foundry to convert speech to text and text to speech.

> **Note:** Different people like to learn in different ways. The text content contains greater detail than the videos; refer to it as supplemental material to the video presentation.

## Choose a speech-capable model

Microsoft Foundry Models is a model catalog that includes generative AI models from multiple providers. Different models have different capabilities, and are optimized for different use-cases.

To find a suitable model, you can use the filter and search features in the Microsoft Foundry Portal.

When it comes to speech-capable models, there are two common use-cases to consider:

- Generative AI models that can transcribe speech to text.
- Generative AI models that can synthesize text to speech.

Microsoft Foundry provides models that support both of these use-cases, including specialized speech-capable models from the **gpt-4o** family of OpenAI models.

> **Tip:** To learn more about available models in Microsoft Foundry, see the [Microsoft Foundry Models overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/concepts/foundry-models-overview) article in the Microsoft Foundry documentation.

## Transcribe speech

Speech transcription, or *speech-to-text*, involves submitting audio content to a model, which responds with a text-based transcript of the speech in the audio source.

Models that support speech-to-text operations include:

- **gpt-4o-transcribe**
- **gpt-4o-mini-transcribe**
- **gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize**

> **Note:** Model availability varies by region. Review the [model regional availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure?pivots=azure-openai#model-summary-table-and-region-availability) table in the Microsoft Foundry documentation.

### Using a speech-to-text model

To use a speech-to-text model in your own application, you can use the **AzureOpenAI** client in the OpenAI SDK to connect to the endpoint for your Microsoft Foundry resource, and upload the contents of an audio file to the model for transcription.

```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI
from pathlib import Path

# Create an AzureOpenAI client
client = AzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=YOUR_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT,
    api_key=YOUR_FOUNDRY_KEY,
    api_version="2025-03-01-preview"
)

# Get the audio file
file_path = Path("speech.mp3")
audio_file = open(file_path, "rb")

# Use the model to transcribe the audio file
transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
    model=YOUR_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT,
    file=audio_file,
    response_format="text"
)

print(transcription)
```

## Synthesize speech

Speech synthesis, or *text-to-speech*, is the reverse of speech-to-text. It involves submitting text to a model, which returns an audio stream of the vocalized text.

Models that support text-to-speech operations include:

- **gpt-4o-tts**
- **gpt-4o-mini-tts**

> **Note:** Model availability varies by region. Review the [model regional availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure?pivots=azure-openai#model-summary-table-and-region-availability) table in the Microsoft Foundry documentation.

### Using a text-to-speech model

Similarly to speech-to-text models, you can use the **AzureOpenAI** client in the OpenAI SDK to connect to the endpoint for your Microsoft Foundry resource, and upload text to a text-to-speech model for speech synthesis.

```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI
from pathlib import Path

# Create an AzureOpenAI client
client = AzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=YOUR_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT,
    api_key=YOUR_FOUNDRY_KEY,
    api_version="2025-03-01-preview"
)

# Path for audio output file
speech_file_path = Path("output_speech.wav")

# Generate speech and save to file
with client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(
            model=YOUR_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT,
            voice="alloy",
            input="This speech was AI-generated!",
            instructions="Speak in an upbeat, excited tone.",
    ) as response:
    response.stream_to_file(speech_file_path)

print(f"Speech generated and saved to {speech_file_path}")
```
